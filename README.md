# xConPP
To replace xCon and add extensibility through modules.
* Allowance to be extended through module support
* Written in pure, easy to understand Logos and Obj-C.
* Actively maintaned with updates.

# Modules
* How it will work:
1. Create a txt file
2. Write the class to hook, and the method in full, separated by a colon :
3. Save As -> mymodule.xcm

That's it :P modules are meant to be simple.

PS: iOSGods, don't steal this for your own :)
